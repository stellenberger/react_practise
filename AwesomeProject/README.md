This is my journey to learn React Native. This repo does not use Expo, and instead uses pure React Native. This is because in a previous repo I used expo, and I found it caused more issues than it solved. Upon reading reviews, Expo seems to have lost its way within the last year with keeping up to date with React Native, and while it can be good for development, in production it can bring about unseen issues from before. Expo also seems to pull the wool over ones eyes when it comes to Native app development and limits the programmer to their ability, and being a purist at times, I would prefer to see the whole codebase.
